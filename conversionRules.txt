**** Conversion rules: AMBER -> LAMMPS LJ coeffs ****

For each pair of atom types (i,j), with j>=i, the prmtop file stores the LJ
coeffs in A,B format:
      V_ij = A_ij/r_ij^12 - B_ij/r_ij^6
where * A = 4 eps_ij sigma_ij^12
      * B = 4 eps_ij sigma_ij^6
with  * eps_ij = depth of the potential well (kcal/mol)
      * sigma_ij = distance at which the potential is zero (A)
      
Lammps expects:  sigma_ii eps_ii 
for each atom type

Solving the system: 
      * sigma = (A/B)^(1/6)
      * eps = B^2/(4A)

*** Warning: AMBER frcmod expects yet another format:
      * R_vdw = Van der Waal's radius = 2^(1/6-1) sigma
              = half of the radius giving the min of the potential well
                (which is 2^(1/6) sigma)
      * eps = as above 

**** Conversion rule: AMBER -> LAMMPS dihedrals ****

AMBER formula: E_d = (PK/IDIVF) * (1 + cos(PN*phi - PHASE))

where * PK = The barrier height divided by a factor of 2
      * IDIVF = The factor by which the torsional barrier is divided 
      (most often 1)
      * PN = The periodicity of the torsional barrier
      * PHASE = The phase shift angle in the torsional function
      
The frcmod file lists the coefficients in this format:
      IPT , JPT , KPT , LPT , IDIVF , PK , PHASE , PN
where IPT , JPT , KPT , LPT = atom types involved in the dihedral

Note: If PN < 0 then the torsional potential
        is assumed to have more than one term, and the
        values of the rest of the terms are read from the
        next cards (lines) until a positive PN is encountered (this 
        positive PN is still part of the dihedral).
        The negative value of PN is used only for identifying
        the existence of the next term and only its absolute value is used.
        
E.g. Suppose the frcmod file contains the lines:

os-cx-c3-os    1     1.17500000    0.000  -2.0    SCEE=1.2 SCNB=2.0
os-cx-c3-os    1     0.14400000    0.000   3.0    SCEE=1.2 SCNB=2.0
cx-c3-os-ca    1     0.38333333    0.000   3.0    SCEE=1.2 SCNB=2.0

os-cx-c3-os has PN = -2. Hence, the next card will also contribute to the 
energy of this dihedral type. Since the next card has PN = 3 > 0, it is the
last one for this dihedral type. So, the energy of os-cx-c3-os is:
    E = 1.175*(1+cos(2*PHI-0)) + 0.144*(1+cos(3*PHI-0))
The subsequent card corresponds to a different dihedral type, cx-c3-os-ca.

LAMMPS formula: E_d = K(1+d*cos(n*phi))

where * K = barrier height divided by 2
      * d = +/- 1
      * n = periodicity of the torsional barrier, integer > 0
      
The Dihedral Coeffs section of the data file lists the coeffs in the format:
    K d n
      
CONVERSION: 
      * K = PK/IDIVF
      * d = 1 if PHASE = 0; d = -1 if PHASE = 180 (because cos(x+180)=-cos(x))
      * n = |PN|
      
E.g. Consider again os-cx-c3-os. This dihedral type has double periodicity, i.e.
its energy is given by the sum of two terms, as shown above. Since these two 
terms have different barrier heights and different periodicities, they 
correspond to two different LAMMPS dihedral types:

    1  1.175 1 2
    2  0.144 1 3
      
Hence, if dihedral i-j-k-l is of AMBER type os-cx-c3-os, it needs to appear
twice in the Dihedrals section of the LAMMPS data file. Once with type 1 and 
once with type 2, so that both terms contribute to the dihedral Hamiltonian, 
as required by AMBER.

OBS: this means that multiple AMBER types correspond to a single LAMMPS type; 
hence, assigning AMBER names to LAMMPS dihedral cannot happen in a 1-to-1 
fashion.
